# Cryptopals

This is Dylan's attempt at doing the Cryptopals problems in Go. I'm doing this
for a couple reasons: I want to learn Go, I want to play around with crypto, and
it's fun. Chances are this code isn't great reference code.

See https://cryptopals.com for details.

Nope. This isn't intended for use in any real projects, and the whole point of
it is that I'm doing it myself. Go try it out yourself!

## Licensing Details

[MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) yada yada; I don't really
recommend using this code in any production system but feel free to steal it
shamelessly. All of this is owned by and written by me except the data files
(which come from the above linked cryptopals website).

This is open source because there are other open source cryptopals solutions, so
I'm not enabling cheating on the problems. Also there is no point to cheating;
if you're looking at this and thinking "I should try it" just go do it!

Since problem set 8 isn't available online, if I do get around to writing
solutions for it, I won't post them here.
